  Admin Dashboard:  
The Admin Module is responsible for user management, system monitoring, and OCR 
application configuration. It provides administrative control over the entire system, ensuring 
smooth operation and efficient OCR process handling. 
User Management: 
The User Administration feature allows admins to add, edit, and delete user accounts while 
assigning specific roles and permissions. This ensures that OCR functionalities are accessible 
only to authorized users. Administrators can monitor user activities, track processing history, 
and manage account-related settings. 
System Logs and Monitoring: 
The System Monitoring and Logs Module tracks all system activities, including user logins, 
image processing details, and extracted text history. Admins can review logs to ensure 
security, analyze system performance, and detect potential errors or misuse. The Application 
Configuration Sub-Module allows admins to adjust OCR processing parameters, UI settings, 
and language models, ensuring that the system remains adaptable to different user needs, 
supporting multiple languages and text formatting options. 
User Dashboard: 
The User Module is designed to provide a simple and intuitive experience for extracting text 
from handwritten images. It focuses on image processing, text recognition, and post
processing to ensure high accuracy and usability. 
Text Post-Processing and Editing 
The Image Upload and Preprocessing Sub-Module allows users to upload handwritten 
images, which undergo grayscale conversion, noise removal, and normalization to enhance 
quality before OCR extraction. The OCR Processing Sub-Module uses the CRNN-CTC model, a 
deep learning-based approach that efficiently recognizes handwritten text without requiring 
manual segmentation. The Text Post-Processing and Editing Sub-Module enables users to 
review and refine extracted text using automatic spell-checking and language modeling for 
improved accuracy. Users can also manually edit or format the recognized text for better 
readability. This feature ensures that the extracted text maintains clarity and precision, 
reducing errors in digitized documents. 
 Download and Exporting Text 
The Download and Export Sub-Module allows users to save extracted text in formats such as 
TXT, PDF, or DOC, providing flexibility in storing and sharing recognized text. This feature 
makes it easy to integrate the extracted text into other applications, such as word processors, 
databases, or automated workflows. 
By combining automated and manual post-processing, the User Module ensures that the OCR 
system provides high accuracy, efficiency, and ease of use. These features make it ideal for 
applications in education, research, business, and historical document digitization. 
User Profile and history  
The User Profile and History Sub-Module (if enabled) allows users to access past OCR results, 
manage processed images, and retrieve extracted text for future reference. This feature 
enhances usability by offering quick access to previously processed documents, improving 
workflow efficiency. It ensures users can review, edit, or reuse extracted text without needing 
to reprocess images, making the OCR system more convenient and user-friendly.
